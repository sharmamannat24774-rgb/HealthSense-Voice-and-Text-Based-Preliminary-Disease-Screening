# HealthSense: Voice and Text-Based Preliminary Disease Screening

## Project Overview
This repository contains the source code for our research project, which combines patient voice data and textual symptom descriptions to create a more accurate disease screening tool. We use a *CNN-LSTM* model for audio and a *fine-tuned BERT* model for text.

## Files
* src/health_sense_pipeline.py: The main code for training and fusion.
* paper/Research_Paper_Final.pdf: The official research paper.
* requirements.txt: List of all Python libraries needed.

## How to Run the Code
1.  Install necessary libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
2.  Run the main script: python src/health_sense_pipeline.py
